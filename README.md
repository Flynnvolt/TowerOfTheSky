TowerOfTheSky

Game Idea:
There is a tower that is so tall it seems to endlessly climb into the sky.
You fight your way through floors to get higher and higher.
On certain floors there will safe floors that have merchants and stuff, and you can return to these.
and maybe once a floor is cleared you can decide to claim it and build a little home base on it.
